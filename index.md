# About {#about}

**Girolamo Macaluso**  
PhD Student in Artificial Intelligence  
[Media Integration and Communication Center](https://www.micc.unifi.it/), University of Florence, Italy

📍 Florence, Italy · ✉️ [girolamo.macaluso@unifi.it](mailto:girolamo.macaluso@unifi.it) · 🔗 [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/girolamo-macaluso-b50571164) · 💻 [GitHub](https://github.com/ganjiro) · 🎓 [Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LyxLJXMAAAAJ)

My research is dedicated to making Reinforcement Learning more efficient and scalable. I began by exploring offline and hybrid offline→online RL methods to maximize learning from static datasets, then developed techniques to cut the computational and memory costs of state-of-the-art algorithms. I’m now advancing continual RL frameworks that adapt to evolving environments and applying RL to fine-tune diffusion models.
